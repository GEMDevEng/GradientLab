\f0\fs24 \cf0 Below is a full, detailed, and comprehensive task list for the project to build a web application that automates the setup and management of virtual machines (VMs) for running Sentry Nodes in the Gradient Network. This task list is organized by the project\'92s six phases\'97Planning and Preparation, Web Application Development, Infrastructure Setup, Node Operation and Data Collection, Data Analysis, and Reporting and Dissemination\'97followed by additional tasks for long-term operation and scalability. The project aims to study network effects and reward mechanisms within the Gradient Network, leveraging free-tier cloud resources with a $0 budget and a 60-month timeline for potential scaling through grants.\

\
### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation\
\
1. **Establish research goals** to investigate Proof-of-Availability (POA), Proof-of-Connectivity (POC), and referral impacts within the Gradient Network.\
2. **Define key metrics** for the study, including reward rates (points/day), node uptime (%), referral bonus contributions, and network effect correlations.\
3. **Review Gradient Network documentation** to understand node setup processes, reward calculation formulas, and ethical participation rules.\
4. **Identify constraints** from the documentation, such as unique IP requirements per node and node status categories (e.g., "Good," "Disconnected").\
5. **Select free-tier cloud platforms** for VM provisioning, focusing on Oracle Cloud (4 VMs), Google Cloud (1 VM), and Microsoft Azure (1 VM).\
6. **Assess limitations** of each cloud platform, including VM quotas, RAM, storage, and trial durations.\
7. **Plan initial VM and node deployment**, targeting 6 VMs: 4 on Oracle Cloud, 1 on Google Cloud, and 1 on Azure, with one Sentry Node per VM.\
8. **Develop an IP management strategy** to ensure IP diversity using different cloud regions and free VPNs like Proton VPN Free.\
9. **Document IP assignments** for each VM to prevent reward penalties from shared IPs.\
10. **Set up accounts** on the selected cloud platforms (Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud, Azure).\
11. **Generate API keys and configure permissions** for programmatic VM management on each cloud platform.\
\

\
### Phase 2: Web Application Development\
\
12. **Design the web application architecture**, specifying a Python Flask backend for RESTful APIs, a React.js frontend for the user interface, SQLite for database storage, and integration with cloud SDKs (e.g., Oracle Cloud\'92s `oci`).\
13. **Set up the development environment** by installing necessary tools such as Python 3.9, Node.js 18, Git, and required libraries.\
14. **Configure virtual environments** for Python and initialize version control with GitHub.\
15. **Develop backend APIs**, including endpoints for VM provisioning, Sentry Node deployment, data collection, and referral management.\
16. **Implement automation scripts** within the backend for installing and configuring Sentry Nodes on VMs.\
17. **Develop frontend components**, including a dashboard to display VM count, node status (e.g., "Good," "Disconnected"), and total rewards.\
18. **Create a VM management interface** with a table allowing actions to start, stop, or delete VMs.\
19. **Implement data visualization components**, such as line and bar charts, to display reward trends and node uptime.\
20. **Develop settings pages** for users to input cloud credentials and configure alert preferences.\
21. **Integrate the frontend with the backend** by connecting React components to Flask APIs using HTTP requests (e.g., Axios).\
22. **Implement JWT-based authentication** to secure user access to the application.\
23. **Write unit tests** for core backend functions and frontend components.\
24. **Perform integration tests** to ensure proper communication between frontend, backend, and database.\
25. **Conduct end-to-end tests** simulating full user workflows, such as logging in, deploying a node, and viewing analytics.\
26. **Debug the application and optimize for performance**, targeting API response times under 2 seconds.\
27. **Deploy the backend** to a free hosting platform like Heroku or Render.\
28. **Deploy the frontend** to a free hosting service such as Netlify or GitHub Pages.\
29. **Set up CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.\

\
### Phase 3: Infrastructure Setup\
\
30. **Provision 6 VMs** using the web application: 4 on Oracle Cloud, 1 on Google Cloud, and 1 on Azure.\
31. **Verify connectivity** to each VM and ensure unique IP assignments.\
32. **Install necessary software** on each VM, including headless Chromium for Sentry Node operation and dependencies like Node.js and Python.\
33. **Configure VPNs or proxies** on VMs if needed to enhance IP diversity.\
34. **Install the Sentry Node browser extension** on each VM.\
35. **Connect each Sentry Node** to the Gradient Network Dashboard.\
36. **Enable POA and POC** for each node (uptime tracking for POA and network taps for POC).\
37. **Set up real-time monitoring** through the web application to track node status.\
38. **Configure alerts** for node downtime or errors, deliverable via email or in-app notifications.\
\
---\
\
### Phase 4: Node Operation and Data Collection\
\
39. **Start all Sentry Nodes** via the web application to begin earning rewards.\
40. **Operate nodes continuously**, aiming for high uptime (>95%) to maximize POA rewards.\
41. **Perform periodic POC taps** (1\'962 per day per node) to earn POC rewards.\
42. **Ethically simulate referrals** within Gradient Network guidelines to study their impact.\
43. **Collect and store reward data**, including POA points, POC points, and referral bonuses, in the SQLite database.\
44. **Monitor node status and performance** through the dashboard, addressing issues like disconnections or errors promptly.\
\
---\
\
### Phase 5: Data Analysis\
\
45. **Analyze collected data** to compute average reward rates for POA, POC, and referrals.\
46. **Correlate node uptime, IP uniqueness, and referral activity** with reward outcomes.\
47. **Assess the impact** of shared IPs or low uptime on reward penalties.\
48. **Identify optimization strategies** for maximizing rewards, such as maintaining high uptime and ensuring IP diversity.\
\

\
### Phase 6: Reporting and Dissemination\
\
49. **Compile research reports** detailing the methodology, data collection process, analysis results, and conclusions.\
50. **Create visualizations**, such as charts and graphs, to illustrate key findings like reward trends and uptime statistics.\
51. **Share findings** with the Gradient Network community and academic outlets by publishing on platforms like arXiv or GitHub.\
52. **Solicit feedback** from the community to inform future improvements and research directions.\

\
### Long-Term Operation and Scalability\
\
53. **Monitor free-tier usage** across cloud platforms to ensure compliance with resource limits.\
54. **Implement automation** to shut down idle VMs and conserve resources.\
55. **Optimize resource allocation** by using lightweight libraries, caching mechanisms, and data compression techniques.\
56. **Prepare and submit grant applications** to secure funding for scaling the project to 50\'96100 VMs over the 60-month period.\
57. **Plan for application enhancements**, such as adding mobile support, advanced analytics, or multi-cloud failover capabilities.\
58. **Ensure ongoing ethical compliance** by avoiding bot-like behaviors, maintaining transparency, and anonymizing collected data.\
59. **Perform regular maintenance** on the application, including updating dependencies, addressing security patches, and ensuring compatibility with evolving cloud services.\
60. **Conduct periodic reviews** of research findings and application performance to refine strategies and improve the study over the 60-month period.\
