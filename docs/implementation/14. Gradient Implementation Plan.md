\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Implementation Plan for Gradient Network Research Web Application\
\
This **Implementation Plan** provides a detailed, comprehensive roadmap for developing, deploying, and scaling the Gradient Network Research Web Application over a 60-month period. The project focuses on automating virtual machine (VM) provisioning, Sentry Node deployment, and data collection to study network effects within the Gradient Network\'97a decentralized compute platform built on Solana. Given the $0 budget constraint, the plan leverages free-tier cloud resources and open-source tools, with a strategy for scaling via future grants. The plan is structured into six distinct phases\'97Planning, Development, Infrastructure Setup, Operation, Analysis, and Reporting\'97ensuring a systematic approach to achieving the project\'92s research and operational goals.\
\
---\
\
## Project Overview\
The Gradient Network Research Web Application aims to:\
- Automate the setup and management of VMs and Sentry Nodes.\
- Collect data on Proof-of-Availability (POA), Proof-of-Connectivity (POC), and referral mechanisms.\
- Analyze network effects, such as reward distribution and node performance, within the Gradient Network.\
- Operate within a $0 budget using free-tier cloud services, with scalability planned over 60 months.\
\
The plan assumes familiarity with the Gradient Network\'92s mechanics, as outlined in its official documentation (e.g., node requirements, reward systems, and ethical guidelines), and targets a lean, automated workflow to maximize efficiency.\
