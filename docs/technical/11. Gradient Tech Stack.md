### Direct Answer\
\
#### Overview\
The tech stack for the Gradient Network Research Web Application is designed to help researchers study network effects using free resources, keeping costs at $0. It supports tasks like setting up virtual machines (VMs), running Sentry Nodes, and simulating social media accounts over 60 months.\
\
#### Authentication\
For signing up, logging in, and logging out, we use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. This keeps your login secure and works well with our backend, ensuring only you can access your research data.\
\
#### Data Storage\
We store all your actions, like VM setups and node data, in a **database**. We start with **SQLite**, which is free and simple, and can switch to **PostgreSQL** later if we get grants to handle more data over time.\
\
#### Payments\
Since we're on a $0 budget, there\'92s **no payment system**. The project focuses on earning points within the Gradient Network, not handling money.\
\
#### Security\
To protect your data, we use **HTTPS** for safe communication, **JWT** for secure logins, and check inputs to prevent hacking. This keeps everything safe and private.\
\
#### Frontend\
The **frontend**, where you interact with the app, uses **React.js**. It\'92s great for dashboards showing VM status, node rewards, and charts for social media growth, making it easy to use.\
\
#### Backend\
The **backend**, handling the logic and APIs, uses **Python with Flask or FastAPI**. This manages tasks like setting up VMs on cloud platforms and collecting data, keeping things fast and efficient.\
\
#### Notifications\
For alerts, we use **email** through SMTP (like Gmail\'92s free tier) for important updates, like VM issues, and **in-app notifications** for real-time changes, like node status.\
\
#### Analytics\
To track how you use the app, we use **Matomo**, a free tool that respects privacy, helping us see which features you use most without extra costs.\
\
This stack ensures we can study network effects effectively, starting small and scaling up, all while staying within budget.\

### Comprehensive Analysis of the Gradient Network Research Web Application Tech Stack\
\
#### Introduction\
This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed tech stack for the Gradient Network Research Web Application, initiated in April 2025. The application aims to support researchers studying network effects and reward mechanisms within the Gradient Network, a decentralized edge compute platform on Solana, by automating virtual machine (VM) setup for running Sentry Nodes and simulating social media influencer accounts. Given the $0 budget, the project leverages free-tier cloud resources, with plans for scaling over 60 months using grants. This document incorporates insights from provided attachments ("Gradient Project Description.md," "Gradient Network Effects.md," and "Gradient Web Idea.md") to outline the tech stack, ensuring all critical elements\'97authentication, database, payments, security, frontend, backend, notifications, and analytics\'97are addressed while complying with the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Software Requirements Specification (SRS).\
\
#### Project Background\
The Gradient Network, as described in the documentation ([Gradient Network, open layer for edge compute on Solana]([invalid url, do not cite])), is designed to make compute resources accessible through decentralized infrastructure, with participants earning rewards by running Sentry Nodes (lightweight browser extensions) and engaging in referral programs. The research project, detailed in the attachments, seeks to understand reward mechanisms (Proof-of-Availability [POA], Proof-of-Connectivity [POC], and referrals) and network effects by participating in the network and simulating influencer behavior. The web application, proposed in "Gradient Web Idea.md", is a critical component to automate infrastructure setup, manage simulations, and collect data, aligning with the project's goal of maintaining a $0 budget through free-tier resources like [Oracle Cloud Free Tier, always free cloud services]([invalid url, do not cite]) and [Google Cloud Free Tier, free cloud computing resources]([invalid url, do not cite]).\
\
#### Methodology and Scope\
The application's methodology involves automating VM provisioning on free-tier platforms (e.g., Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure), deploying Sentry Nodes, configuring VPNs/proxies for IP diversity, running simulations, collecting reward data, and supporting scalability. The scope includes user authentication, real-time monitoring, data export, and integration with cloud APIs, all while ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines and platform terms of service. The tech stack must support all PRD user stories, user flows, and SRS functional/non-functional requirements, operating within budget constraints and ensuring long-term operation over 60 months.\
