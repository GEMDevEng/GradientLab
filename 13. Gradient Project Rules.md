\
## Project Rules for Developers\
\
### 1. **Coding Standards**\
   - **Languages and Frameworks**:\
     - **Backend**: Use Python with Flask or FastAPI for RESTful APIs and automation tasks.\
     - **Frontend**: Use React.js for an interactive UI with real-time updates and visualizations.\
     - **Database**: Use SQLite for the initial MVP; design with a potential migration to PostgreSQL in mind.\
   - **Code Formatting**:\
     - Adhere to **PEP 8** for Python (e.g., 4-space indentation, 79-character line limit).\
     - Use **Prettier** or **ESLint** for JavaScript/React with 2-space indentation.\
     - Maintain consistent formatting across all files.\
   - **Naming Conventions**:\
     - Use **snake_case** for Python variables and functions (e.g., `deploy_sentry_node`).\
     - Use **camelCase** for JavaScript variables and functions (e.g., `renderNodeStatus`).\
     - Use clear, descriptive names that reflect functionality (e.g., `VmProvisioner` instead of `VP`).\
   - **Code Organization**:\
     - Modularize code into logical components (e.g., separate files for VM management, node deployment, and data collection).\
     - Avoid large monolithic files; keep functions concise and focused.\
\
### 2. **Security**\
   - **Authentication**:\
     - Implement **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication.\
     - Support optional OAuth integration (e.g., Google) for researcher logins.\
   - **Data Protection**:\
     - Enforce **HTTPS** for all network communications.\
     - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent **XSS** (cross-site scripting) and **SQL injection**.\
     - Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, credentials) in **environment variables** or a secure vault, never in source code.\
   - **Access Control**:\
     - Restrict VM provisioning, node deployment, and data access to authenticated users only.\
     - Prepare for role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. researcher) if needed later.\
   - **Security Practices**:\
     - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Bandit**.\
     - Log security events (e.g., failed logins) without storing sensitive details.\
\
### 3. **Ethical Guidelines**\
   - **Network Integrity**:\
     - Avoid **Sybil detection triggers** by simulating legitimate influencer behavior on social media platforms.\
     - Do not manipulate or spam the Gradient Network or Solana blockchain.\
   - **Platform Compliance**:\
     - Adhere to the **terms of service** of cloud providers (e.g., Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud) and social media platforms.\
     - Ensure simulated accounts behave naturally to avoid being flagged as bots.\
   - **Data Privacy**:\
     - Collect only anonymized or consented data for research purposes.\
     - Comply with **data privacy laws** (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) where applicable, even on a $0 budget.\
     - Avoid storing personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly required and consented.\
\
### 4. **Documentation**\
   - **Code Documentation**:\
     - Include **docstrings** for all Python functions and classes (e.g., purpose, parameters, return values).\
     - Use **JSDoc** for JavaScript/React components and functions.\
     - Comment complex logic with clear explanations.\
   - **API Documentation**:\
     - Maintain a **Swagger/OpenAPI** specification for all backend endpoints.\
     - Provide examples of request/response payloads for key APIs (e.g., VM provisioning).\
   - **User Documentation**:\
     - Create a **README** with setup instructions, prerequisites, and usage examples.\
     - Develop a **user guide** for researchers, covering features like node deployment and data visualization.\
   - **Maintenance**:\
     - Keep documentation updated with every code change.\
\
### 5. **Testing**\
   - **Unit Tests**:\
     - Write tests for all core functions using **pytest** (Python) and **Jest** (JavaScript).\
     - Aim for at least **80% code coverage** on critical components (e.g., VM provisioning, node deployment).\
   - **Integration Tests**:\
     - Test interactions between frontend, backend, and database (e.g., API calls, data persistence).\
   - **End-to-End Tests**:\
     - Use **Cypress** or **Selenium** to simulate full user workflows (e.g., login 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  deploy node 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  view analytics).\
   - **Test Requirements**:\
     - Ensure all tests pass before merging code.\
     - Include edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, network failures).\
   - **Manual Testing**:\
     - Conduct periodic manual checks of UI responsiveness and real-time updates.\
\
### 6. **Version Control**\
   - **Git Workflow**:\
     - Use **Git** with a `main` branch for stable code and `develop` for ongoing work.\
     - Create feature branches (e.g., `feature/vm-provisioning`) for new development.\
   - **Commit Guidelines**:\
     - Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., "Add Sentry Node deployment endpoint").\
     - Commit small, logical changes frequently.\
   - **Pull Requests**:\
     - Submit **pull requests (PRs)** for all changes, with descriptions of functionality and test results.\
     - Require at least one reviewer approval before merging.\
   - **Branch Management**:\
     - Delete merged branches to keep the repository clean.\
\
### 7. **Performance**\
   - **API Performance**:\
     - Target **<2-second response times** for all API endpoints.\
     - Use asynchronous programming (e.g., FastAPI\'92s `async`/`await`) for I/O-bound tasks like VM provisioning.\
   - **Database Performance**:\
     - Optimize queries with indexes on frequently accessed fields (e.g., `node_id`, `timestamp`).\
     - Minimize database calls in critical paths.\
   - **Resource Efficiency**:\
     - Limit CPU/memory usage to stay within free-tier cloud limits (e.g., Oracle Cloud\'92s 4 VMs).\
     - Shut down idle VMs automatically to conserve resources.\
\
### 8. **Scalability**\
   - **Architecture**:\
     - Design a **modular system** to support horizontal scaling (e.g., separate services for VM management and data collection).\
   - **Caching**:\
     - Implement **in-memory caching** (e.g., Redis, if free-tier available) for node status and analytics data.\
   - **Database Scaling**:\
     - Structure SQLite schema to facilitate migration to **PostgreSQL** as node count grows (e.g., from 10 to 100 VMs).\
   - **Load Handling**:\
     - Plan for gradual scaling over 60 months, starting with 6-10 VMs and expanding with grant funding.\
     - Use load balancing if multiple backend instances are deployed.\
\
### 9. **Communication and Collaboration**\
   - **Team Updates**:\
     - Share progress via weekly **standups** or written updates (e.g., Slack, email).\
   - **Code Reviews**:\
     - Conduct thorough reviews focusing on functionality, security, and adherence to these rules.\

\
### 10. **Budget and Resource Constraints**\
   - **Free-Tier Adherence**:\
     - Use only **free-tier resources** (e.g., Oracle Cloud: 4 VMs, Google Cloud: 1 VM).\
     - Monitor usage to avoid exceeding limits (e.g., set up alerts for resource thresholds).\
   - **Open-Source Tools**:\
     - Rely exclusively on **open-source libraries** (e.g., Flask, React, SQLite) to avoid costs.\
   - **Optimization**:\
     - Implement scripts to shut down unused VMs and minimize resource waste.\
\
### 11. **Analytics and Monitoring**\

     - Integrate **Matomo** (self-hosted, free) for analytics on user interactions and system performance.\
   - **Notifications**:\
     - Send **email** and **in-app alerts** for critical events (e.g., VM provisioning failures, node downtime).\
   - **Logging**:\
     - Log key events (e.g., node deployment, errors) to a file or free logging service.\
\
### 12. **Long-Term Maintenance**\
   - **Backups**:\
     - Automate **weekly backups** of SQLite database and critical logs to a free cloud storage option.\
   - **Dependency Updates**:\
     - Regularly update dependencies to address security patches and compatibility (e.g., `pip install --upgrade`, `npm update`).\
