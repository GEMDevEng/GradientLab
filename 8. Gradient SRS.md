### Comprehensive Survey Note\
\
#### Introduction\
This comprehensive survey note provides a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Gradient Network Research Project, initiated in April 2025. The project aims to study network effects within the Gradient Network, a decentralized edge compute platform on Solana, by participating through running Sentry Nodes and simulating influencer behavior on social media platforms, focusing on empirical results and rewards. Given the $0 budget, the project relies on free-tier cloud resources, with plans for scaling over 60 months using grants. This note incorporates insights from provided attachments ("Gradient Project Description.md", "Gradient Network Effects.md", and "Gradient Web Idea.md") to ensure a thorough understanding of the software requirements.\

#### Project Background\
The Gradient Network, as described in the documentation ([Gradient Network Documentation, open layer for edge compute on Solana](https://gradient.network/docs)), is designed to make compute resources accessible through decentralized infrastructure, with participants earning rewards by running Sentry Nodes (lightweight browser extensions) and engaging in referral programs. The research project, detailed in the attachments, seeks to understand reward mechanisms (Proof-of-Availability (POA), Proof-of-Connectivity (POC), and referrals) and network effects by simulating participant behavior. The web application, proposed in "Gradient Web Idea.md", is a critical component to automate infrastructure setup, manage simulations, and collect data, aligning with the project's goal of maintaining a $0 budget through free-tier resources like [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free).\
