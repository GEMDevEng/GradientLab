## Detailed Survey Note\
\
### Introduction\
This survey note provides a comprehensive breakdown of the project work structure for studying network effects within the Gradient Network, focusing on empirical results through actual participation and rewards. Initiated in April 2025, the project aims to investigate how incentive structures, particularly through Sentry Nodes and referrals, influence network dynamics. Given the $0 budget, the project relies on free-tier cloud resources, with plans for potential scaling through future grants. This note incorporates insights from provided attachments and additional context to ensure a thorough understanding.\
\
### Project Background\
The Gradient Network, as described in the documentation ([Gradient Network Documentation](https://docs.gradient.network/)), is a decentralized edge compute platform on Solana, aiming to make compute resources inclusive and accessible. Participants can earn points by running Sentry Nodes, lightweight browser extensions, and through referral programs, with potential future conversion to monetary rewards via token airdrops. The project, detailed in "Gradient Project Description.md," seeks to understand reward mechanisms, including Proof-of-Availability (POA) and Proof-of-Connectivity (POC), and their impact on network participation.\
\
### Methodology and Scope\
The project's methodology involves setting up infrastructure using free-tier VMs from platforms like Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as outlined in the attachments. It also includes developing a web application to automate tasks, as mentioned in "Gradient Web Idea.md," and potentially scaling up to simulate larger networks, as discussed in "Gradient Network Effects.md." The focus is on empirical data collection, ensuring actual participation in the network to study network effects.\
\
### Detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)\
\
The WBS is structured into six main phases, each with sub-tasks to ensure comprehensive coverage. Below is the detailed breakdown:\
\
#### 1.0 Planning and Preparation\
This phase involves setting the foundation for the project:\
- **1.1 Define research objectives**: Clearly outline goals, such as understanding POA and POC rewards and referral impacts.\
- **1.2 Review Gradient Network documentation**: Study guidelines and reward mechanisms from [Gradient Network Documentation](https://docs.gradient.network/).\
- **1.3 Identify free-tier cloud platforms**: Select platforms like [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) (up to 4 Arm-based VMs) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free) (1 e2-micro VM), considering limitations.\
- **1.4 Determine number of VMs and nodes**: Plan for 6-10 nodes initially, given free-tier constraints.\
- **1.5 Develop IP management strategy**: Address challenges of unique IPs, as rewards split with shared IPs, using different cloud regions or providers.\
- **1.6 Set up accounts on cloud platforms**: Create accounts to access free-tier resources, ensuring compliance with terms.\
\
#### 2.0 Web Application Development/Adaptation\
Given the mention in "Gradient Project Description.md" of adapting a web application, this phase focuses on creating or modifying a tool for automation:\
- **2.1 Assess existing web application (if any)**: Review "Gradient Web Idea.md" for existing plans, potentially starting from scratch.\
- **2.2 Define requirements for adaptation**: Ensure the application automates node setup, reward monitoring, and referral management, as per the attachment.\
- **2.3 Develop or modify backend functions**: Use Python with Flask/FastAPI, as suggested, for API integrations with cloud providers.\
- **2.4 Update frontend as needed**: Create a React or Flask-based interface for user interaction, as outlined in "Gradient Web Idea.md."\
- **2.5 Integrate with Gradient Network APIs or dashboards**: Connect to [Gradient Network Dashboard](https://app.gradient.network/dashboard) for real-time monitoring.\
- **2.6 Test the adapted web application**: Ensure functionality, focusing on automation efficiency within free-tier limits.\
- **2.7 Deploy the web application on a free hosting platform**: Use services like Heroku or Render, as mentioned, to host without costs.\
\
#### 3.0 Infrastructure Setup\
This phase leverages the web application to set up the necessary infrastructure:\
- **3.1 Use web application to provision VMs on selected cloud platforms**:\
  - **3.1.1 Oracle Cloud**: Provision up to 4 Arm-based VMs with 6 GB RAM each.\
  - **3.1.2 Google Cloud Platform**: Provision 1 e2-micro VM with 0.6 GB RAM during free period.\
  - **3.1.3 Microsoft Azure**: Provision 1 B1S Linux VM with 1 GB RAM, also during free period.\
- **3.2 Use web application to install software and configure nodes**: Install Chromium, dependencies, and the Sentry Node extension, ensuring headless browser setup.\
- **3.3 Set up monitoring through the web application**: Configure dashboards to track node status, ensuring continuous operation for POA rewards.\
\
#### 4.0 Node Operation and Data Collection\
This phase focuses on running the nodes and gathering empirical data:\
- **4.1 Use web application to start and manage Sentry Nodes**: Ensure nodes are operational, leveraging automation for efficiency.\
- **4.2 Monitor node status via web application dashboard**: Check status (Good, Disconnected, Unsupported) on [Gradient Network Dashboard](https://app.gradient.network/dashboard), avoiding VPNs/proxies to prevent "Unsupported" status.\
- **4.3 Collect data through web application**: Record points earned from POA (uptime) and POC (successful taps), as well as referral bonuses.\
- **4.4 Perform Proof-of-Connectivity (POC) actions as needed**: Execute network taps to earn POC rewards, logging results.\
- **4.5 Simulate referrals if applicable, ensuring compliance with network guidelines**: Create referral links, track referred nodes, and ensure no fraudulent behavior, as per network rules.\
- **4.6 Log issues and anomalies**: Document any downtime, reward splits due to IP sharing, or other issues for analysis.\
\
#### 5.0 Data Analysis\
This phase involves analyzing the collected data to draw insights:\
- **5.1 Compile collected data**: Aggregate points from all nodes, organizing by time periods for clarity.\
- **5.2 Analyze reward rates from Proof-of-Availability (POA) and POC**: Calculate rates to understand earning potential, considering uptime and tap success.\
- **5.3 Evaluate the impact of referrals on total points**: Analyze 20 points per referral and 10% perpetual bonus on referred nodes' rewards, as per "Gradient Project Description.md."\
- **5.4 Assess the effect of IP sharing on rewards**: Compare rewards for nodes with unique vs. shared IPs, noting splits as a challenge.\
- **5.5 Identify optimization strategies for maximizing rewards**: Determine best practices, such as maintaining high uptime and using unique IPs where possible.\
- **5.6 Compare findings with expected outcomes or hypotheses**: Test initial assumptions, adjusting research questions based on results.\
\
#### 6.0 Reporting and Dissemination\
The final phase focuses on sharing the findings:\
- **6.1 Write a research report including methodology, results, analysis, and conclusions**: Document the process and insights, potentially for academic publication.\
- **6.2 Create visualizations to support findings**: Develop charts for reward trends and graphs for node performance to enhance clarity.\
- **6.3 Prepare for publication in academic journals or conferences**: Format according to guidelines, aiming for research dissemination.\
- **6.4 Share findings with the Gradient Network community**: Post on forums or social media, engaging with participants, and potentially collaborating with the network team for future scaling.\
\
### Challenges and Considerations\
The project faces several challenges, primarily due to the $0 budget:\
- **Free-Tier Limits**: Limited to 6-10 VMs, as detailed in "Gradient Network Effects.md," with Oracle Cloud offering the most (4 VMs indefinitely).\
- **IP Diversity**: Achieving unique IPs is challenging, with rewards splitting if shared, requiring strategic use of different cloud regions.\
- **Long-Term Viability**: Sustaining for 60 months, as planned, may require grants, with applications suggested in "Gradient Network Effects.md" to scale to 50-100 nodes.\
- **Ethical and Compliance**: Ensuring no Sybil activity or fraudulent referrals, as noted, requires careful monitoring and adherence to network guidelines.\
\
