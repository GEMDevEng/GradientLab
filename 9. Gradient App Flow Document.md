### Comprehensive Analysis of the Gradient Network Research Web Application App Flow Document\
\
#### Introduction\
This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed App Flow Document for the Gradient Network Research Web Application, initiated in April 2025. The application aims to support researchers studying network effects within the Gradient Network, a decentralized edge compute platform on Solana, by automating virtual machine (VM) setup for running Sentry Nodes and simulating social media influencer accounts. Given the $0 budget, the project leverages free-tier cloud resources, with plans for scaling over 60 months using grants. This document incorporates insights from provided attachments ("Gradient Project Description.md", "Gradient Network Effects.md", and "Gradient Web Idea.md") to outline user flows, ensuring researchers can efficiently manage their experiments and analyze empirical results.\
\
#### Project Background\
The Gradient Network, as described in the documentation ([Gradient Network, open layer for edge compute on Solana](https://gradient.network/)), is designed to make compute resources accessible through decentralized infrastructure, with participants earning rewards by running Sentry Nodes (lightweight browser extensions) and engaging in referral programs. The research project, detailed in the attachments, seeks to understand reward mechanisms (Proof-of-Availability [POA], Proof-of-Connectivity [POC], and referrals) and network effects by participating in the network and simulating influencer behavior. The web application, proposed in "Gradient Web Idea.md", is a critical component to automate infrastructure setup, manage simulations, and collect data, aligning with the project's goal of maintaining a $0 budget through free-tier resources like [Oracle Cloud Free Tier, always free cloud services](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) and [Google Cloud Free Tier, free cloud computing resources](https://cloud.google.com/free).\
\
#### Methodology and Scope\
The application's methodology involves automating VM provisioning on free-tier platforms (e.g., Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure), deploying Sentry Nodes, configuring VPNs/proxies for IP diversity, running simulations, collecting reward data, and supporting scalability. The scope includes user authentication, real-time monitoring, data export, and integration with cloud APIs, all while ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines and platform terms of service. The app flow document is tailored for researchers, detailing how they interact with the application to achieve their research goals, focusing on usability, scalability, and long-term operation.\

  - Alerts for critical issues (e.g., node disconnected) via email or in-app notifications\
- **Security**: Use HTTPS for all communications, implement JWT-based authentication for API access, store cloud credentials securely (e.g., environment variables), sanitize inputs to prevent XSS attacks, and ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).\
- **Scalability**: Support gradual scaling from initial small-scale setups (e.g., 4 VMs) to larger ones (e.g., 50-100 VMs) with grants, optimize resource usage (e.g., shutting down idle VMs) to stay within free-tier limits, and use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like node status.\
- **Long-Term Operation**: Implement automated backups of critical data (e.g., reward logs), provide mechanisms for software updates (e.g., updating browser extensions), and ensure maintainability over 60 months with modular code structure.\
\
#### Tables for Clarity\
Below is a table summarizing the free-tier resource allocations, as inferred from the attachments:\
\
| Cloud Platform   | Free VMs Available | RAM per VM | Storage | Notes                          |\
|------------------|--------------------|------------|---------|--------------------------------|\
| Oracle Cloud     | Up to 4            | 6 GB       | 200 GB  | Arm-based, no time limit       |\
| Google Cloud     | 1 (e2-micro)       | 0.6 GB     | Limited | Free period, then pay-as-you-go|\
| Microsoft Azure  | 1 (B1S Linux)      | 1 GB       | Limited | Free period, then pay-as-you-go|\
\
Another table for reward mechanisms, based on "Gradient Project Description.md":\
\
| Reward Type         | Description                                      | Notes                                      |\
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\
| Proof-of-Availability (POA) | Earned based on uptime                          | Requires continuous operation             |\
| Proof-of-Connectivity (POC) | Earned through successful network taps          | Depends on network conditions             |\
| Referral Bonuses    | 20 points per referral, 10% perpetual bonus     | Split if referred nodes share IP          |\
\
#### Challenges and Considerations\
The project faces challenges due to the $0 budget, including free-tier limits on cloud resources and the need for IP diversity to avoid reward splits. The application must handle these constraints by optimizing resource usage, leveraging open-source libraries like `oci`, and planning for future scalability as the number of VMs and nodes increases. Ethical considerations include ensuring compliance with Gradient Network guidelines to prevent account bans and adhering to data privacy laws to protect research data.\
\
#### Future Directions\
The project plans to scale up with research grants ($5,000-$100,000) to support increased VM and node counts, potentially enhancing the application with additional features like advanced analytics or improved monitoring. This aligns with long-term research goals, ensuring the application remains a robust tool for studying network effects over 60 months.\
\
#### Conclusion\
This detailed App Flow Document ensures a structured approach to user interactions with the Gradient Network Research Web Application, focusing on managing VMs, deploying Sentry Nodes, and simulating social media accounts. It addresses all aspects from onboarding to settings, considering challenges and future scalability, providing a comprehensive framework for researchers to conduct their experiments effectively.\
